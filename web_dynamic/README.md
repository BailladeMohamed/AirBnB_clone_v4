# 0x06. AirBnB clone - Web dynamic

This repository is about the linking of `api` folder & `web_static` through `web_dynamic`. JQUERY is being used to do DOM manipulations, send & get data from the API

To setup data for mysql, use

```bash
cat dump.sql | mysql -u root -p
```

To run the API, use

```bash
bash run_api.sh
```  

To run the web, use

```bash
bash run_web.sh <TASK_NUMBER>
```

**FYI**:

- For some tasks, you will first need to launch the API before the web, so do not forget to launch the API wherever its asked

Happy testing !!!
